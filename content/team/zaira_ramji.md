Hi hi! I’m Zaira, the VP Events for Schulich Ignite. I’m responsible for organizing club events like the end-of-semester Gala where mentees have a chance to present their projects and engage with a panel of industry speakers. I am currently in my fourth year of Software Engineering. In my free time I enjoy gaming (particularly RPGs), drawing, and embroidery!
