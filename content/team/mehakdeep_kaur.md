Hi! I’m Mehak, President of Schulich Ignite. I lead the team to make sure we run great coding workshops and events that help our members grow and connect. I’m in fourth-year software engineering and love AR/VR. Outside of coding, I enjoy painting and reading mystery and fantasy novels, especially ones with clever plot twists! Excited for a great year ahead!
