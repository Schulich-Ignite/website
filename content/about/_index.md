Schulich Ignite is a student run organization led by passionate and motivated volunteers. Our team strongly believes in our mission and puts in hard work year-round to provide high quality programs to our students. The team consists of students currently pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in various programs including software engineering, computer science, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Many of our mentors also have industry experience and can offer valuable insight to students that are interested in pursuing tech-related careers.

Schulich Ignite would not be possible without the efforts of our highly dedicated mentors and executive team. We wish that our hard work helps inspire you and we hope to meet you at our next workshop!
