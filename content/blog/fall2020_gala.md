Schulich Ignite celebrated the end of our fall sessions with a Gala! At the Gala, we congratulated our students for completing the workshop. After spending the last 8 weeks mastering the fundamentals of programming, many of our students worked on projects that they showcased at the Gala. It was truly incredible to see such complex and creative projects from students who started with little to no experience in programming! The Gala also consisted of a panel discussion with speakers from the software industry. We would like to extend our gratitude to Aysha Panatch, Hansel Qiu, Dan Cyca and Diego Casati for volunteering their time to come speak at the event. Both our students and mentors learned a lot! We would also like to thank Dr. Mohammad Moshirpour for his continuous support of the Schulich Ignite program and making our mission to inspire the next generation of programmers possible. 
Last, but not least, we want to say thank you to all of our mentors! We truly appreciate the time you take out of your busy schedules to help inspire younger students. We could not do what we do without you. And with that, the Schulich Ignite team is proud to say that the Fall sessions were a success! We can't wait to see you in February for our Winter workshop!
