## What is ignite Scorch?

Note: Ignite Scorch will not be taught this Winter 2025 semester, we encourage you to take Python Beginner or Flare!

Ignite Scorch is an 8 week introduction to web development course, split up into 1.5 hour sessions once a week. The aim of the course is to give people a chance to explore web development, and learn the skills they need to get websites up and running. Since this is a more advanced course you will need to know the programming fundamentals taught in [ignite beginner](/beginner) & [ignite flare](/flare), but **no prior web development experience is required**.

## What will I learn?

By the end of the course you will:

- Be able to **create a website** from **scratch** or **template** and take it right through to **deployment**
- Understand **what is happening in a browser** when we visit a webpage
- Have an idea of some **industry practices** that will make us more effective in web development
- Have an idea of **other fields** web development skills can be used

We achieve this a bit differently, by having mentees work on exercises inspired by real world requirements. Right from session 1 you will be buiding webpages, by session 2 fully mobile responsive sites, and by the end you will have the knowledge to design, build, deploy, and secure those websites!

Along with just how to do the basics, we teach you other principles in building websites like:

- Basic **design principles**
- **Security** and privacy practices
- How to pick **alternatives** to what we suggest
- Suggestions for **where to go to dive deeper** into the topics

## Anything else I should know?

We also have an end of session gala where we have industry speakers come in and do presentations. We also give mentee's a chance to show off their projects (if they want to).
