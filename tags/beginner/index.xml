We might want to check if someone has a premium account before allowing them to access a song, or check if they&amp;rsquo;re in a certain country etc.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/data-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/data-types/</guid><description>Everything starts with data in programming. If you want to be able to do anything you need to be able to work with data.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/functions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/functions/</guid><description>Functions are a way to reuse code efficiently.
