Sometimes we want to execute code based on something. We might want to check if someone has a premium account before allowing them to access a song, or check if they&amp;rsquo;re in a certain country etc.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/data-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/data-types/</guid><description>Everything starts with data in programming.

This means if you have an operation you want to run 1000 times, or maybe run some code for every user in a database, or show a menu until someone makes a choice in a game, loops are what you want.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/packages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/packages/</guid><description>Packages allow you to break up code into chunks that make it easier to understand what each piece is doing. How this works is up to the language, typically there will be a defined file/folder structure that is used to define packages.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/paths/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/paths/</guid><description>Many times when you are writing a program you will need to find something. For example you will need to open a file to read it&amp;rsquo;s contents, or send users a page based on their URL.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/variables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://schulichignite.com/definitions/variables/</guid><description>When working with code you will inevitably want to store some information.
